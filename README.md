CarbonBytes: Digital Carbon Footprint Tracker
Overview
CarbonBytes is a browser extension that helps users track, understand, and reduce their digital carbon footprint. By monitoring online activities and suggesting eco-friendly alternatives, this tool empowers users to make environmentally conscious choices while browsing the web.
The Problem
Digital activities carry a significant environmental cost that often goes unnoticed:

The internet consumes approximately 1021 TWh/year of electricity
In 2022, the US emitted 6.343 billion metric tons of CO2 equivalent
Digital data growth is accelerating faster than sustainability measures can address
Common online activities produce substantial carbon emissions:

Google Search: 0.2g CO2e per search (3.85g with typical browsing behavior)
AI-Powered Search: 4.14g CO2e per response
Video Streaming: 0.42 kg CO2e per hour
